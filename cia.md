# CIA
* Confidentiality\
-> Data is only available to people who are permitted to see it
* Integrity\
-> Data can only be modified by people who are permitted
* Availability\
-> People who are permitted must have access to their data

## Authentication
* The key to all 3 is proper authentication

### MAC
* Message Authentication Code\
-> Attaching a code to ensure your message isn't tampered with
-> Helps integrity as others cannot edit the data on the way
* Never encrypt then MAC, causes problems, always do MAC then encrypt

### CBC mode
* A form of block encryption that I don't understand\
-> Provides confidentialty (As does all encryption)
