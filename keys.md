# Keys
> Public key cryptography allows for one key to be used for the entire world with no data breaches. 
* Other people use your public key to encrypt and you use your private key to decrypt

## Bits of Security
> Breaking the system takes `2^n` steps\
where `n` is the *bits of security*\
* 128 bits is the minimum requirement
* 192 is recommended and 256 is secure
